# TinyAuth

A utility for minimal user authentication.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tiny_auth'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

First, create a table to store your users:

```ruby
create_table :users do |t|
  t.string :email, null: false
  t.string :password_digest, null: false
  t.string :reset_token
  t.datetime :reset_token_expires_at
  t.index :email, unique: true
  t.index :reset_token, unique: true
end
```

Your model should look like this:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
end
```

Now, you're ready to use `TinyAuth`:

```ruby
auth = TinyAuth.new(User)

user = auth.find_by_email('user@example.com')
user = auth.find_by_credentials('user@example.com', 'password')

token = auth.generate_token(user)
user = auth.find_by_token(token)

reset_token = auth.generate_reset_token(user)
user = auth.exchange_reset_token(user, password: "changed")
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
